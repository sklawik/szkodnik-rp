When I was 14-15 I coded this gamemode. My first completed project written in Pawn scripting language. 
This is SA:MP (sa-mp.com) San Andreas: Multi Player roleplay server written in pure Pawn without many additional plugins/includes.

Broken setup, first fix there errors:
- The project was about to be converted to mysql database instead of file, it's not completed.
- sa-mp.com forum is down so it's hard to find missing plugins and includes for the project to compile.
- Data should not be stored in memory, unfortunely I coded whole 18k lines like that :P At least, learned my lesson as a kid.
